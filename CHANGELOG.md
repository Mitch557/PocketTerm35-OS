# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (2026-10-19)

After upgrading, reflash the keyboard with `sudo pt35-kbd flash` and run
`pt35-ai agents --reset` if you use the AI agent. The firmware and the agent
rules below only take effect then.

### Security

- Joining a Wi-Fi network no longer runs its name as a shell command. Before,
  picking a nearby network named `$(...)` ran that command. The menu now passes
  the name to nmcli as an argument.
- The Default and Code agents ask before they run `git diff` or `git log`. The
  `--output` flag of either can overwrite any file.

### Fixed

- Pressing `2` on a confirmation such as Shut down or Close all no longer
  answers Yes.
- The face buttons keep working after a sway reload with `$mod+Shift+c`. pt35d
  sees the reload and binds them again.
- The patched firmware prints nothing but its brightness answer. Its debug
  output could fill the console buffer and stop the keyboard.
- `B50` now reads back 50, not 49. Fn `-` stops at 5% instead of turning the
  panel off. Letting go of Fn before Select takes the screenshot and no longer
  opens the switcher.
- A typo in one theme file now drops only that file, and the menu shows which
  file and line. The next Appearance pick no longer wipes a broken
  `appearance.toml`. The shell writes picks, pins and recents to a temporary
  file and renames it, so a power cut cannot leave half a file.
- When a window closes, the switcher's cursor stays on the window it was on.
  Closing a card behind you no longer moves you to another app.
- A search you are typing stays when a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi scan refreshes the
  list.
- A tap on a filtered Quick panel changes the row you tapped. The sliders move
  on each press instead of a press or two later.
- Each app with a profile shows once in the launcher and always starts with
  its profile. A `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications` overrides the
  system copy, and one with `Hidden=true` hides the app. The launcher reads
  `XDG_DATA_DIRS` and checks `TryExec`, `OnlyShowIn` and `NotShowIn`.
- You can join a Wi-Fi network whose name has a `:` or `\` in it. The Quick
  panel shows the network's SSID and whether the radio is on.
- Apps started from the shell no longer stay behind as zombie processes.
- pt35d asks a stock keyboard for its firmware three times per plug-in instead
  of every 10 seconds, so `pt35-kbd flash` gets through. It notices when
  `pt35-kbd restore` takes the patched firmware away.
- With pt35d not running, the menu can still close. The sway config restarts
  pt35d and the bar when they die.
- A helper that hangs, such as wpctl, bluetoothctl, nmcli or grim, no longer
  hangs the daemon or a menu screen. Each one now has a time limit.
- The bar shows the wired icon only with a cable in, and never a `--` battery.
  With many windows open it shrinks the dock slots instead of drawing them
  under the status icons.
- The menu draws the last frame of each glide, so the highlight lands exactly
  on its row.
- Menu errors are visible. The hint bar used to cover the error line.
- The wheel stops at the end of a list instead of jumping to the other end.
  Releasing a scrollbar drag over a row no longer opens that row. In Mouse
  mode, tapping the B pill opens the row's options, as pressing B does.
- Uninstalling a source install through curl now also undoes the greetd setup.
- postinst no longer creates a missing `~/.config` owned by root.
- `pt35-ai` downloads a model again when its pinned checksum changes.
- `pt35-kbd write` checks the new file before it replaces the old one.

### Changed

- A, B and X no longer repeat in Buttons mode. Holding one while the menu
  opened could crash sway 1.10.
- Qt apps fall back to XWayland when the Qt Wayland plugin is missing.

## 0.3.2 (2026-09-24)

### Fixed

- An app's context menu no longer covers the launcher. Opening the menu over
  a right-click menu left the popup on top, holding the keyboard. The popup
  now closes when the menu opens.
- The DarkWire Default agent stops reaching for sudo. It tried
  `sudo journalctl`, the sudo rule refused it, and it gave up. The prompt now
  says logs need no sudo and shows the command for recent errors. Run
  `pt35-ai agents --reset` to pick up the new prompt.

## 0.3.1 (2026-09-24)

### Added

- A local AI agent: `pt35-ai` installs llama.cpp, llama-swap and pinned
  models, with darkwire as the chat client and five agents. The DarkWire
  tile opens it.

### Changed

- The menu is the desktop when nothing is open on the workspace in front,
  so an app that exits leaves you on the launcher.

### Fixed

- Lock was a white screen: swaylock with no config paints white. It now
  uses the theme's colours, unless you have a swaylock config of your own.
- Screen off had no way back but ssh. Any key or touch now turns the
  panel on again. This needs `swayidle`, now a dependency.
- The power key no longer opens the power menu under the lock, where it
  waited after the unlock with Screen off selected.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-23)

First release.
